* Markov Text Generator in Rust

This is just a silly little project to explore Rust.

The program reads in text files and builds a Markov model of the character transitions.  From these models, it can generate new random text with similar statistical properties to the source material.

I recently cargoized it, and it now depends on a cargoized fork I made of rust-msgpack.
